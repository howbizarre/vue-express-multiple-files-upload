# Multiple files upload with Vue 3 and Express

This is a straightforward way to use Vue 3 as front-end and Express as the back-end to upload multiple files to a folder on the server.

The project depends on [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) to handle the upload.

The upload process accepts only .jpg and .png files but you can change it if you want.

You should have some experience with Vue 3, Express, and Node 'cos this is not a beginner's tutorial.

Open the project root folder in VS Code. Split the terminal by two and run the following commands in each terminal:

```bash
npm run server
```

```bash
npm run client
```

Then... Go to umproved for your needs.

***FYI***: Nodemon is used to run the server for some easing and DX, but if you prefer other or just Node - do your changes. Everthing will work the same.
